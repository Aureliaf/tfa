                <p>“TricksToGo” is an app that was created by a team of four students during a workshop. This application shows the user a countdown of remaining days before vacation and gives one tip per day that depends on the destination of his trip.</p>

                    <h5>Look for an idea</h5>
                    <p>Before the workshop, we already made an interview of someone working. Meeting professionals helped us to understand them better and to reveal several problems which they meet in their activity.</p>
                    <p>Then, we started to think individually about what could improve the daily lives of workers. Different ideas came to our minds : identify parking spaces near the workplace,  indicate waiting time for snacks around the worker, making a sport application for breaks ...</p>
                    <p>We had a few great ideas but what is more motivating than seeing that there are only a few days left before the holidays ?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="idea__el text">
                    <h5>Try & rethink</h5>
                    <p>After being validated, we tried to imagine an application fast and easy to use everyday. Our goal was to offer the user a motivating and user-friendly application.</p>
                    <p>We made quick wireframes but during the user testing, we detected several contradictions. Users didn’t click were we expected to access the triks so we added a button only for the first visit of the app to guide the user.</p>

                    <h5>Imagine & create</h5>
                    <p>Our application is based on the material design. Flat colors, simple and refined icons seemed perfect to achieve both a simple and dynamic design.</p>
                    <p>After trying a lot of options for our 4 icons, we finally chose to use different declinations in our design.</p>
                    <p>For our logo, we wanted something which that recalls our holidays. I started by listing everything that reminds it to us. The first tracks weren’t really what we expected because it didn’t evoke the countdown aspect. Then, we decided to combine a clock and a sun in our logo.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="design__el design__el--bigtext text">
                    <p>The first designs we created formed an  inconsistent whole because we all did a small part to go faster. Therefore, we tried to restore coherence between the different pages.</p>
                    <p>We replaced white backgrounds by a shade darker than the header for each sreen and we decided not to give the choice of the color to the user anymore.</p>
